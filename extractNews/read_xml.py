        'news': ' Dan Carson Chron   NASA scientists are attempting to reestablish contact with a satellite that serves as part of an agency array tracking the formation and movement of hurricanes in the Earth\'s oceans, Space.com\'s Robert Lea reported Thursday.   The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) is billed as the "first space-based system to collect frequent measurements of wind speeds from the ocean\'s surface" and is tasked with tracking activity near the eyes of forming cyclones, typhoons and hurricanes. The system is comprised of eight separate spacecraft that in aggregate form a picture of maritime storm behavior around the world used by scientists to project and measure severe weather activity.   This network has been compromised in part over the last several weeks after one of its crafts, designated "FM06," stopped communicating measurements in late November. The system continues to operate without the unit\'s participation but will have a lower valence of coverage without the missing piece of the network, according to the agency.   "If the team isn\'t able to reestablish contact, the FM06 satellite would primarily affect the constellation\'s spatial coverage," NASA said in a statement released on Dec. 9 . "However, the CYGNSS constellation could continue to meet its scientific requirements and objectives."   The unique system began development at the University of Michigan in 2012 on the back of a $152 million investment from NASA and was launched into orbit in 2016. The mission achieved its primary research goals by 2019 and has since been operating in an extended mission status, according to Lea. The tools at its disposal include low-frequency GPS microwaves capable of penetrating thick cloud cover and measuring wind speeds close to the water surface near major maritime storms, allowing scientists to get a more accurate picture of the speed and severity of large systems.   Hurricane season in Texas in 2022 was uncharacteristically uneventful , while large named storms such as Hurricane Ian ravaged significant portions of Florida\'s Gulf-facing western coast.'},

        'title': 'Fed could hike interest rates more than expected, official warns [New York Post, The]',
        'news': " Quit gaslighting Americans, Joe — inflation is still terrible   The inflation tide has turned — no thanks to the Fed   Recession fears rise as Fed eyes another interest rate hike   New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Friday it remains possible the US central bank raises interest rates more than it currently expects next year, adding that he's not expecting the economy to fall into recession as Fed policymakers press forward with action to tame unacceptably high inflation   “We're going to have to do what's necessary” to get inflation back to the Fed's 2% target, Williams said in an interview on Bloomberg's television channel. He said monetary policy will need to become restrictive and the peak federal funds rate next year, which Fed policymakers projected this week at 5.1%, “could be higher than what we've written down.”   Williams, who is also vice chair of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, noted that “inflation has been stubbornly high … and we've seen the economy remain very resilient to higher interest rates.”   “We're going to have to do what's necessary” to get inflation back to the Fed's 2% target, NY Fed President Williams said.   REUTERS   But when it comes to some Wall Street forecasts that argue the Fed may need to go as high as 6% or 7% on the federal funds rate target, Williams said “that's definitely not my baseline.”   Williams was the first Fed official to weigh in after the central bank on Wednesday raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by half a percentage point to the 4.25%-4.50% range , as expected. The Fed also upgraded its estimate of how far it will need to raise rates to lower inflation and predicted weaker economic growth and higher unemployment.   see also   Fed slows pace of rate hikes as inflation cools   In his news conference after the end of the Dec. 13-14 policy meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that the actions he believes the central bank will need to take will create challenges for the economy, saying “I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability. There isn't, and this is the best we can do.”   Williams said he doesn't see a downturn in the economy as inevitable, noting that in terms of the Fed's current outlook, “I don't see this as a recession. We're clearly not in a recession right now.”   The minutes from the Fed's November policy meeting showed that central bank staff economists viewed the risks of recession against continued growth as roughly even. Meanwhile, on Thursday, the New York Fed said its internal economic model sees a 0.3% decline in overall activity next year and flat growth in 2024, with a return to growth the year after.   ‘Absolutely committed'   The New York Fed chief also said recent inflation data has been more positive amid improving supply chains and other factors, but he said high service-sector inflation remains an issue and a target of Fed action. He added that wage gains are high but not something akin to a 1970s-style force driving up overall price pressures.   The Fed has faced criticism for being too slow to start raising rates to lower inflation, which has been running at 40-year highs, but Williams said that he doesn't believe the central bank has lost credibility with markets and the public.   What do you think? Be the first to comment.   “We're absolutely committed to get inflation back to our 2% goal, and we're acting in that way,” Williams said, adding “I don't think we've lost the credibility” of being seen as resolute inflation fighters.   Williams also said that in terms of any possible disconnect between the market and Fed views of the economic future, “I think pretty much everyone understands that real interest rates need to get restrictive and stay there.”"},

        'news': 'data from S&P Global Market Intelligence , after the business spending-management software specialist agreed to be bought out for $8 billion.   Coupa has been subject to merger rumors for weeks, but announced on Monday private equity firm Thoma Bravo would be taking it private in an all-cash deal at $81 per share, a 77% premium to its closing price on Nov. 22, the last full trading day before speculation of a possible sale began.   Image source: Getty Images.   So what   Coupa is a provider of software that helps companies track and manage their corporate spending, an especially useful skillset for an economy possibly heading toward a recession next year. It would make the company an attractive partner.   Several private equity firms were reportedly interested, but Coupa lead independent director Roger Siboni said in a statement that Thoma Bravo\'s "compelling and certain cash consideration in the transaction provides superior risk-adjusted value relative to the Company\'s stand-alone prospects."   The buyout also includes a significant minority investment from a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.   Prior to the takeover rumors starting , Coupa\'s stock had lost more than three quarters of its value despite having enjoyed rising sales and bookings throughout the year. Coupa also reported third-quarter results the day after the merger announcement that showed an equally strong performance.   Revenue grew 17% to $217.3 million from $185.8 million and handily beat Wall Street forecasts of $212 million. Coupa also narrowed net losses to $85 million from $91 million, under generally accepted accounting principles GAAP while on an adjusted basis it had profits of $11.6 million, or $0.15 per share. Although that was down sharply from the $0.31 per share earned in the year ago period, it was well ahead of analyst forecasts of $0.27 per share.

        'news': " TYSONS, Va. Dec. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ever since the release of the redaction feature, VIDIZMO (the creator of Gartner-Recognized enterprise video platform and IDC-Recognized Digital Evidence Management System) began evolving the highly requested solution for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data preservation – now released as a one-stop complete redaction solution, dedicated to manual and automated processes for redaction in video, audio, images, and much more.   VIDIZMO offers a one-stop redaction tool, dedicated to manual and automated processes for redaction.   With data privacy and confidentiality being a major issue in the present age of digitalization, redaction is the solution for concealing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from non-consented viewership and sharing. Video files such as CCTV and body camera footage, press video streams and 911 call recordings are some examples where the public (and their PII data) is usually recorded. All this data calls for the need for redaction.   VIDIZMO's redaction tool started off as a feature offering both automatic and manual redaction , simultaneously catering to the requirements for efficiency and accuracy. AI-powered detection allows selective automated redaction with ease, coupled with manual redaction to redact more specific portions.   With time, enhancements paved the way for the VIDIZMO redaction feature to be provided as a Standalone Tool due to high customer demand in early 2022. The feature, and later the tool, works using VIDIZMO's own indexer for automated and on-demand AI-powered detection . This allows it to be deployed with ease to redact video online over the cloud as SaaS or on a customer's local, on-premises environment.   When it comes to detection, VIDIZMO has managed to train diverse data sets to accommodate the detection of faces, people, multiple types of vehicles, license plates, and weapons such as knives and firearms - but this is an ever-expanding list.   Ultimately, VIDIZMO aims to create a one-stop platform for all PII redaction needs and legal requirements. VIDIZMO has already covered video, image and audio redaction at different lengths using its Redaction Tool, available both as a standalone tool and part of its other two solutions – EnterpriseTube and Digital Evidence Management System   VIDIZMO further plans to incorporate document redaction , along with OCR capabilities, for better searchability. To assist detection processes, VIDIZMO also plans to release new artificial intelligence features.   These include better automation through recognizing detected faces across videos and images. The detected faces can be redacted collectively across videos, making the process more efficient. Moreover, VIDIZMO is working on a Custom AI-models feature to allow customers to train their own data sets for detection, to best fit to their use case and add efficiency to the redaction process.   VIDIZMO's end goal with the above-mentioned feature sets and future development, is to make sure the user gets all their redaction needs answered in an easy-to-use, one-stop complete redaction solution.   About VIDIZMO   VIDIZMO provides secure enterprise video content management and digital evidence management systems to Fortune 500 companies and government organizations around the world. Packed with around 20 years of experience with everything video, VIDIZMO is also a Microsoft IP Co-sell Gold Partner and AWS Partner.

PFE + Free Alerts Celldex Therapeutics Inc.   CLDX + Free Alerts , and Hologic Inc.   HOLX + Free Alerts are ramping up efforts to help reduce or eliminate the growing breast cancer mortality rate.   As it stands now, breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in women in the U.S. It is estimated that 43,780 people — 43,250 women and 530 men — will die from breast cancer this year alone.   Globally, female breast cancer is the fifth leading cause of death. An estimated 684,996 women worldwide died from breast cancer in 2020, with metastatic breast cancer causing the vast majority of the deaths.   The increasing death rate has led companies like BriaCell Therapeutics Corp.   BCTX + Free Alerts   BCTXW + Free Alerts BCT to advance research and development into therapies that could prove more effective against breast and other cancers.   Focusing initially on breast cancer, BriaCell is dedicated to enhancing the lives of people with cancer with limited therapy options by developing novel immunotherapies to fight the disease.   Immunotherapies have become the forefront of cancer treatments because they use the body's immune system to destroy cancer cells, offer the potential for higher levels of safety and efficacy than chemotherapy and may also prevent cancer recurrence.   BriaCell currently has a non-exclusive clinical trial collaboration with Incyte Corporation   INCY + Free Alerts to evaluate the effects of combinations of novel clinical candidates.   BriaCell is currently conducting a Phase I/II clinical trial of its lead product candidate, Bria-IMT™, in combination with the immunotherapy development candidate retifanlimab, an anti-PD-1 antibody provided by Incyte, for the treatment of advanced breast cancer.   On December 8, BriaCell presented positive safety/tolerability and efficacy data from its lead product candidate – Bria-IMT™ – summarized in three poster sessions during the 2022 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium ® (SABCS).   The posters are summarized below and also available to view here: https://briacell.com/scientific-publications/   Mayo Clinic Professor and Principal Clinical Investigator Saranya Chumsri, M.D., stated in an audio summary of the poster: “First, this is a heavily pretreated group of end-stage metastatic breast cancer (“MBC”) patients. For many of these patients, other therapies don't exist or cannot be tolerated.”   “Bria-IMT™ does not have any theoretical cross-resistance or overlapping toxicity with other MBC treatments, which is why it is so encouraging to see responses across all MBC subtypes and a very manageable adverse event experience,” she added.   Dr. William V. Williams, BriaCell's President and CEO, also commenting on the data, said, “We are impressed with the positive clinical and quality of life data in this very difficult-to-treat patient population who have failed multiple prior treatments. We're delighted that many patients stayed on our study longer than their last therapy, suggesting the Bria-IMT™ combination regimen is both well tolerated and clinically effective.”   According to him, “these results have positive implications, both for our ongoing, randomized phase II study and for planned meetings with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the design of our pivotal study. Advanced MBC remains one of the most difficult cancers to treat.”   “There remains an urgent, unmet medical need to find well-tolerated and effective treatments for these gravely ill cancer patients who have only months to live and cannot tolerate the harsh side effects of other cancer treatments,” Williams concluded.

        'news': " Wasps, however, will be playing in the Championship next year after administrators FRP agreed to an offer by a consortium from members of Wasps Legends.   Both clubs were relegated from the Premiership after entering administration, with both appeals rejected to overturn the decision.   The bid for Warriors from Atlas Worcester Warriors Ltd which is fronted by Jim O'Toole and James Sandford has been refused by the RFU who were not satisfied with the “financial position of the buyer and their ability to continue to fund the club and to deliver on the business plan”.   The RFU has now urged the club's administrator Begbies Traynor to consider bids which secure professional rugby at Sixways stadium. In its statement, the RFU says it was, “concerned by the public statement from the bidders that they are prepared to acquire the site and develop it without a rugby offering.   “The RFU urges the administrator not to progress any sale that does not guarantee a future for rugby within the local community.   “For these reasons the RFU does not have comfort that the business plan can be funded, nor that rugby is at the centre of the proposal for the business which is an American medical services company.   “The bidders for Worcester Warriors have not accepted the regulatory position and have not sufficiently engaged with the necessary conditions required and have therefore put themselves in a position where the RFU Board could not approve their bid”.   Julie Palmer, Joint Administrator of Worcester Warriors said in a statement:   “The Joint Administrators/Receivers are willing to re-enter into discussions with any interested parties although they will first need to satisfy the RFU's takeover process given the conditions being placed on any proposed purchase. We await confirmation from the RFU on the relevant timelines for them to reach this position given the urgency of the matter. This must include total clarity on the rugby creditor position given the very late notice of an additional material claim from the PRL which other interested parties were not aware of.   “The Joint Administrators statutory duty is to maximise the return to creditors. Therefore, any offer from interested parties must equal or exceed the offer made by Atlas Worcester Warriors who we were informed were able to proceed on an outright purchase of the business and assets excluding the P share. We received notice that the P share option price is being exercised by means of the call option and can confirm that the accepted offer would have resulted in the best return to creditors.   “We urge the relevant stakeholders to work collaboratively and in a timely manner with all interested parties (including Atlas Worcester Warriors) to ensure that elite rugby remains in Worcester.   “We have also offered an urgent meeting over the weekend between the RFU and Atlas Worcester Warriors to try and resolve the position. Both of these parties have made it consistently clear that they remain committed to returning rugby to Worcester which extends to the Women's team.”"},

Sign up to receive daily headline news from Regina Leader-Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.   Vanda Research highlighted a largely risk-off sentiment among investors in its latest report by pointing to a 4.4% year-over-year drop in single-stock purchases by retail traders to $173 billion even as inflows into ETFs rose nearly 14% to $116 billion.   On average, retail investors' portfolios are down about 39% in 2022 after recording gains of 18% in 2021, JPMorgan analysts Peng Cheng and Emma Wu said.   “The ethos is really starting to spread in the retail investor community that if you want to build wealth through your investments, take a long-term view,” Maximilian Rofagha, chief executive officer of Finimize, an abdrn-owned insights firm, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum (GMF).   Finimize's recent survey of 2,300 retail punters showed that despite their worries of a recession, only 1% wanted to exit their investments, with about 65% planning to continue investing and 29% aiming to invest more despite the cost-of-living crisis.   The investment trend, however, is leaning more toward ETFs tracking broader markets and away from the meme stock frenzy of 2021 that saw retail investors banding together on social media forums to fuel eye-popping gains in GameStop, AMC and others. Shares of GameStop and AMC are down 63% and 45%, respectively, this year.   S&P 500 index-tracking SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is the most purchased U.S. security among equities by retail investors this year, attracting $26.4 billion in inflows, compared with $17.7 billion last year, Vanda data showed.   Other top five purchases include Nasdaq-100 index-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust as well as the ever-popular shares of Apple Inc, Tesla Inc and Advanced Micro Devices.   The sudden spike in borrowing costs, soaring inflation and fears of a looming recession have weighed on the ability of the Americans to stomach wild swings in stocks this year.   “We don't expect any speculative bursts to hold without a sustained rebound in both their portfolio and across the market,” Vanda Research analyst Lucas Mantle said.   Retail investors' average daily trading volume in U.S. stocks has amounted to $13.8 billion so far in 2022, compared with $14.2 billion a year earlier, which was the peak of meme stock trading frenzy, according to the report.   “Where is future growth going to come from? Fundamentals matter more in the environment that we are in right now when you're starting to see questions like ‘are we in a recession or not,'” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management in Chicago.   As for the coming year, January could see strong equity inflows from retail clients, especially after down market years like 2022, Bank of America Global Research said, citing data that dates back to 2008.   Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday voted to propose some of the biggest changes to American equity market structure in nearly two decades, aimed at boosting transparency and fairness while increasing competition for individual investors' stock orders.

         'title': 'Fed Could Raise Rates More Than It Has Priced In, Williams Says [International Business Times]',
         'news': 'New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Friday it remains possible the U.S. central bank raises interest rates more than it currently expects next year, adding that he\'s not expecting the economy to fall into recession as Fed policymakers press forward with action to tame unacceptably high inflation. "We\'re going to have to do what\'s necessary" to get inflation back to the Fed\'s 2% target, Williams said in an interview on Bloomberg\'s television channel. He said monetary policy will need to become restrictive and the peak federal funds rate next year, which Fed policymakers projected this week at 5.1%, "could be higher than what we\'ve written down." Williams, who is also vice chair of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, noted that "inflation has been stubbornly high ... and we\'ve seen the economy remain very resilient to higher interest rates." But when it comes to some Wall Street forecasts that argue the Fed may need to go as high as 6% or 7% on the federal funds rate target, Williams said "that\'s definitely not my baseline." Williams was the first Fed official to weigh in after the U.S. central bank on Wednesday raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by half a percentage point to the 4.25%-4.50% range, as expected. The Fed also upgraded its estimate of how far it will need to raise rates to lower inflation and predicted weaker economic growth and higher unemployment. In his news conference after the end of the Dec. 13-14 policy meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that the actions he believes the central bank will need to take will create challenges for the economy, saying "I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability. There isn\'t, and this is the best we can do." Williams said he doesn\'t see a downturn in the economy as inevitable, noting that in terms of the Fed\'s current outlook, "I don\'t see this as a recession. We\'re clearly not in a recession right now." The minutes from the Fed\'s November policy meeting showed that central bank staff economists viewed the risks of recession against continued growth as roughly even. Meanwhile, on Thursday, the New York Fed said its internal economic model sees a 0.3% decline in overall activity next year and flat growth in 2024, with a return to growth the year after. \'ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED\' The New York Fed chief also said recent inflation data has been more positive amid improving supply chains and other factors, but he said high service-sector inflation remains an issue and a target of Fed action. He added that wage gains are high but not something akin to a 1970s-style force driving up overall price pressures. The Fed has faced criticism for being too slow to start raising rates to lower inflation, which has been running at 40-year highs, but Williams said that he doesn\'t believe the central bank has lost credibility with markets and the public. "We\'re absolutely committed to get inflation back to our 2% goal, and we\'re acting in that way," Williams said, adding "I don\'t think we\'ve lost the credibility" of being seen as resolute inflation fighters. Williams also said that in terms of any possible disconnect between the market and Fed views of the economic future, "I think pretty much everyone understands that real interest rates need to get restrictive and stay there."

         'news': " After trading momentarily above the $18,000 price mark, Bitcoin's [BTC] price rebounded to exchange hands below $17,500 after the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 50 basis points (bps) at its meeting on 14 December.   The decline in the price of the king coin after the Feds' meeting coincided with the surge in the cost of mining on the BTC network. According to CryptoQuant analyst Abramchart , while BTC traded below the $18,000 price region, the cost of mining one BTC reached $19,463, indicating that miners at work on the BTC network mined at a loss.   Read Bitcoin's [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024   Abramchart assessed BTC's historical performance based on this and opined that the bottom might be in. According to the report, the analyst found a historical correlation between the periods when miners mined BTC at a loss and when BTC logged a price bottom.   “The loss of miners began since June 12, 2022, when bitcoin reached $26,700, and the cost of mining one bitcoin at that time reached $29,450. The same movement appeared at the bottom of March 2020, the cost price of mining was higher than the value of Bitcoin and also the bottom of 2018,” Abramchart said.   Source: CryptoQuant   Another CryptoQuant analyst MrPapi, shared the same opinion. He conducted a BTC price adjustment for money supply in the past few years and also concluded that the “floor is in.”   Due to the impact of COVID-19 in the last two years, the United States government had to print more money to cushion the economic stress on its people. According to MrPapi, an adjustment of BTC's price chart for the increased money supply revealed a correlation between the current BTC cycle and that of 2019.   “Using this chart, it suggests the floor was in between $15k and $17k,” MrPapi concluded.   Source: CryptoQuant   New money, stronger hands   An on-chain assessment of BTC's Network Profit and Loss ratio (NPL) revealed the re-entry of new demand towards the end of November. Data from Santiment showed a significant dip in BTC's NPL ratio on 18 November, after which its price went up.   NPL dips are often seen as indicators of a short-term sell-off by less confident investors, known as “weak hands,” and the return of more strategic investors referred to as “smart money.” These dips are often followed by a rebound in price and a period of recovery.   Source: Santiment   With increased whale accumulation and increased favorable macro conditions we gear up to close Q4 2022. Well, it might sustain a further rally in the value of the leading coin in 2023."},

         'title': 'Average long-term US mortgage rates inch down this week [Chronicle-Telegram, The (Elyria, OH)]',
         'news': 'The average long-term rate reached 7.08% as recently as early November.  Mortgage rates are still more than double what they were a year ago, mirroring a sharp rise in the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The yield is mostly influenced by global demand for U.S. Treasurys and investor expectations for future inflation, which heighten the prospect of rising interest rates overall.  The Federal Reserve raised its rate again Wednesday by 0.50 percentage points in a bid to bring down the highest inflation in decades. It was the Fed’s seventh increase this year and pushed the central bank’s key rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, its highest level in 15 years.  More surprisingly, the policymakers forecast that their key short-term rate will reach a range of 5% to 5.25% by the end of 2023. That suggests that the Fed is poised to raise its rate by an additional three-quarters of a point and leave it there through next year.  The Fed made clear, in a statement and a news conference by Chair Jerome Powell, that it thinks sharply higher rates are still needed to fully tame the worst inflation bout to strike the economy in four decades.  The sharp rise in mortgage rates this year, combined with still-climbing home prices, have added hundreds of dollars to monthly home loan payments relative to last year, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage hovered around 3%.  That’s created a significant affordability hurdle for many would-be homebuyers, spurring this year’s housing market downturn. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell for the ninth consecutive month in October, hitting the slowest pre-pandemic annual sales pace in more than 10 years.  The rate for a 15-year mortgage, popular with those refinancing their homes, fell to 5.54% from 5.67% last week. It was 2.34% one year ago.'},

         'title': 'Qatar budget surplus exceeds QR77bn in 9 months [Gulf Times (Qatar)]',
         'news': ' The 2022 budget surplus is mainly due to the remarkable control over expenditures and the rise in revenues with the recovery seen in oil prices.   During the past few years, the budget figures saw some limited margin surplus in 2021 (QR1.6bn), 2019 (QR7bn), and 2018 (QR15bn); and a deficit in 2015 (QR4.2bn), 2020 (QR10.4bn), 2017 (QR44.7bn), and 2016 (QR50.8bn) — the biggest deficit in the last 10 years.   When approving the state\'s budget for the fiscal year 2022, the estimates showed an expected deficit of QR8.3bn, which HE the Minister of Finance Ali bin Ahmed al-Kuwari attributed to the operational expenditure (Opex) related to the World Cup hosting activities, including security and operational expenses for all activities related to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022.   In this regard, the data issued by the Ministry of Finance showed that the total actual budget revenues during the first 9 months of 2022 reached QR232.6bn, with QR193.9bn coming from oil and gas, and QR38.6bn from non-oil revenues — making it exceed the 2021 total revenue of QR193.7bn.   The data indicated that the total expenditures in the same period amounted to QR155.2bn, of which QR47.5bn were for salaries and wages, QR51.2bn for current expenses, QR3.4bn for incidental capital, and QR53.1bn for major projects.   The quarterly comparison of the 2022 actual budget data indicated an increase of 31.85% in revenues and 1.17% in expenditures in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.   The data also showed an increase of 26% in revenues and 0.78% in expenditures in the third quarter compared to the first, while the comparison of the second and third quarters showed a 4.43% decrease in revenues and a 0.38% decrease in expenditures in the third quarter.   Professor of Economics at Qatar University Dr Rajab al-Ismail described the approach of benchmarking the oil prices in the state\'s 2022 general budget and setting it at the level of $55 per barrel as positive, saying that it is a required approach so for the state to deal with the worst case scenarios. Programming a lower price compared to circulated prices enables dealing with market fluctuations more wisely and secures continuation of comfortable financing of the budget\'s various items, he said.   In his remarks to Qatar News Agency, al-Ismail said a slight profit margin in the budget is much better than a deficit, which may lead to a lack of financial discipline that impacts projects and programmed expenditures.   With a much bigger profit margin compared to the budget reference rates, there will be progress in implementing the programmed plans and projects.   The 2022 general budget was based on $55 per oil barrel as an average price, given the remarkable recovery of energy prices in global market markets.   This approach aims to maintain the financial balance and limit the impacts of oil price fluctuations on public finance performance.   Al-Ismail explained that Qatar has invested surpluses from oil and gas revenues in the budget in safe investment channels such as government bonds, in addition to the contributions and shares acquired by the Qatar Investment Authority in major successful international companies, whose revenues in turn feed the budget, in addition to the possibility of directing these surpluses to pay off various liabilities such as debts, according to the assessments adopted in this field.   He expected that the 2023 budget would be built on a reference oil price estimated at $55, similar to the figure approved in the current year, especially in light of the prices in global markets, which fluctuated in the last period between $75 and $80.   He pointed out that fiscal policies aim to achieve stability and boost economic growth.   The 2022 budget estimated total spending at QR204.3bn, an increase of 4.9% over the 2021 budget.   This increase in spending is mainly due to the temporary increase in operating expenses related to the activities of hosting the 2022 World Cup, as an amount of QR74bn had been allocated for major projects from the total expenditures of the general budget for 2022.   For his part, economic analyst Ahmed Aqel, said in a similar statement to QNA, that "the surpluses that have been achieved during this year, so far, are very important, as they exceeded QR77bn, knowing that the expectations of the International Monetary Fund at the beginning of this year was at QR45bn.   He believed that the reason for this large increase in surpluses, especially in the second quarter (more than QR33bn) and the third (QR30bn), is the differences between the reference price in the budget for the year 2022, which was very conservative at $55 a barrel, and the oil price, which amounted to more than From $100 during the first nine or ten months of the year 2022, which allowed the budget to achieve very high and excellent surpluses.   He explained that the expenditures that were recorded during this period, which were rational and within the expectations, and the rise in oil and gas prices are the main reasons for the surpluses achieved, and he expected that the size of the budget surplus in the fourth quarter would touch the level in the first quarter (approximately QR13bn), which means the surpluses achieved by the end of the year 2022 will be a record and between QR90bn and QR100bn.   The infrastructure projects, the development of citizens lands, and projects to develop public services such as health and education received priority spending in the general budget for the fiscal year 2022, in parallel with the State\'s continued focus on the education and health sectors, while education allocations amounted to about QR17.8bn, which represents 8.7% of the total expenditures; QR20bn have been allocated to the health sector, which represents 9.8% of the total expenditures.'},

         'title': 'Fed Could Raise Rates More Than It Has Priced In, Williams Says [International Business Times]',
         'news': 'New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Friday it remains possible the U.S. central bank raises interest rates more than it currently expects next year, adding that he\'s not expecting the economy to fall into recession as Fed policymakers press forward with action to tame unacceptably high inflation. "We\'re going to have to do what\'s necessary" to get inflation back to the Fed\'s 2% target, Williams said in an interview on Bloomberg\'s television channel. He said monetary policy will need to become restrictive and the peak federal funds rate next year, which Fed policymakers projected this week at 5.1%, "could be higher than what we\'ve written down." Williams, who is also vice chair of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, noted that "inflation has been stubbornly high ... and we\'ve seen the economy remain very resilient to higher interest rates." But when it comes to some Wall Street forecasts that argue the Fed may need to go as high as 6% or 7% on the federal funds rate target, Williams said "that\'s definitely not my baseline." Williams was the first Fed official to weigh in after the U.S. central bank on Wednesday raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by half a percentage point to the 4.25%-4.50% range, as expected. The Fed also upgraded its estimate of how far it will need to raise rates to lower inflation and predicted weaker economic growth and higher unemployment. In his news conference after the end of the Dec. 13-14 policy meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that the actions he believes the central bank will need to take will create challenges for the economy, saying "I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability. There isn\'t, and this is the best we can do." Williams said he doesn\'t see a downturn in the economy as inevitable, noting that in terms of the Fed\'s current outlook, "I don\'t see this as a recession. We\'re clearly not in a recession right now." The minutes from the Fed\'s November policy meeting showed that central bank staff economists viewed the risks of recession against continued growth as roughly even. Meanwhile, on Thursday, the New York Fed said its internal economic model sees a 0.3% decline in overall activity next year and flat growth in 2024, with a return to growth the year after. \'ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED\' The New York Fed chief also said recent inflation data has been more positive amid improving supply chains and other factors, but he said high service-sector inflation remains an issue and a target of Fed action. He added that wage gains are high but not something akin to a 1970s-style force driving up overall price pressures. The Fed has faced criticism for being too slow to start raising rates to lower inflation, which has been running at 40-year highs, but Williams said that he doesn\'t believe the central bank has lost credibility with markets and the public. "We\'re absolutely committed to get inflation back to our 2% goal, and we\'re acting in that way," Williams said, adding "I don\'t think we\'ve lost the credibility" of being seen as resolute inflation fighters. Williams also said that in terms of any possible disconnect between the market and Fed views of the economic future, "I think pretty much everyone understands that real interest rates need to get restrictive and stay there."

         'news': " Spot gold rose 0.6% to $1,787.88 per ounce, as of 9:53 a.m. ET (1453 GMT). It is down about 0.5% for the week so far, having hit a one-week low in the previous session.   U.S. gold futures were up 0.4% at $1,794.30.   “A lot of traders are focusing on both the Fed and ECB, which signalled that more tightening is going to happen and we've seen global bond yields rise significantly, and that's why gold is having a down week,” Edward Moya, senior analyst with OANDA, said.   The Fed had on Wednesday raised interest rates by 50 basis points as expected, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank will deliver more interest rate hikes next year, despite growing recession worries. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England signalled a similar rate-hike strategy.   Gold is considered a hedge against inflation, but interest rate hikes raise the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.   On the day, gold was firmer on a corrective bounce from Thursday's strong selling pressure, Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco Metals said in a note.   “Gold may be getting a mild safe-haven bid as the U.S. and global stock markets are selling off in the wake of still-hawkish major central banks.” [MKTS/GLOB] [.N]   Commerzbank sees gold falling back towards $1,750 per ounce until it is clear that the Fed's cycle of interest rate hikes is over, and expects prices to rise to $1,850 by the end of 2023.

         'news': 'Soaring gas prices have fed into high electricity costs across  this year, prompting the EU to plan a reform of its power market to reduce the impact of gas prices on power bills for industry and households.A an Commission document, seen by Reuters, sketched out ideas for that reform - which it said Brussels will propose in time for a meeting of EU country leaders on March 23.The Commission will consider options to stop non-gas generators from receiving "excessive" revenues - possibly by extending an emergency measure the EU rolled out this year, which claws back revenues from generators to invest in countries\' green transition and by helping consumers with high energy bills, the document said."One possible option would be to apply such a revenue limitation on a more permanent and harmonised basis or to activate it specifically in crisis situations," said the draft document, which could still change before it is shared with EU countries.an electricity prices are set by the production costs of the last power plant needed to meet demand - typically, a gas plant.Soaring gas prices this year have made it possible for lower-cost non-gas power producers to sell their electricity at high prices set by the cost of gas generation, despite not facing higher fuel costs.But industry groups say many renewable generators have not reaped such rewards, since they already sell their power under fixed price contracts - and have warned capping revenues could deter investors from the massive expansion of renewable generation needed to meet climate goals."It is clear that the changes under discussion would have wide-ranging impacts on market participants. This in turn could also affect the mood of investors," said Kristian Ruby, secretary general of power industry association Eurelectric.Another option could be to encourage different types of payment contracts for new non-gas power plants entering the market, like wind and solar farms, to try to keep power prices low for consumers while guaranteeing a predictable revenue stream for the generators, the document said.This could be done through incentives for power consumers to agree long-term power purchase agreements with power plants, or tenders where power plants would bid for government provided contracts-for-differences, it said.(Reporting by Kate Abnett; editing by Jonathan Oatis)By Kate Abnett'},

         'news': "morning, speculation centered around a potential presidential campaign-related announcement amid dwindling for the former president   Come Wednesday morning, Trump announced an “official Donald Trump Digital Trading Card collection” in the form of NFTs.   “Collect all of your favorite Trump Digital Trading Cards, very much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting,” Trump said on Truth Social. “Only $99 each!”   What are NFTs and what is Trump's collection?   NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital assets that are tied to its owner. Through cryptocurrency technology and clever programming tricks, each NFT is unique and in turn, has its own value, usually determined by its demand from prospective buyers.   As of Friday morning, the website where you could buy the NFTs says the collection is sold out. The site says that 45,000 NFTs were created, 44,000 of which were available for purchase for $99 each. The NFTs now sell for at least around $200 on OpenSea, an NFT exchange site.   “Better than Lincoln, better than Washington,” Trump said of his presidency in a video announcement of the NFT collection. “These cards feature some of the really incredible artwork pertaining to my life and my career, it's been very exciting.”   The digital trading cards depict Trump in various different outfits and extravagant settings. One NFT features Trump shooting laser beams out his eyes in front of Trump tower while another has Trump fist pumping while riding an elephant.   “Remember, Christmas is coming and this makes a great Christmas gift,” Trump said.   Eroding support for Trump   Trump's announcement tease stirred speculation that it was related to his 2024 reelection bid. Trump has seen his support slide among Republican allies and supporters alike for disappointing midterm results for the GOP and dining with a Holocaust denier.   An exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that only 31% of GOP and GOP-leaning voters wanted to see Trump run for reelection.   When it came to a different presidential nominee, the poll found that those voters vastly prefer Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over Trump at 56% to 33%.   Announcement draws ridicule   Trump's announcement has drawn criticism and ridicule from both his frequent opponents and allies especially after the collapse of FTX, a major cryptocurrency exchange, has drawn intense scrutiny.   President Joe Biden mocked Trump and tweeted his own “MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS” touting his administration's latest string of successes such as codifying same-sex marriage into law.   Former White House strategist and counselor to Trump, Steve Bannon, reacted to the announcement on his “War Room” podcast, saying “I can't do this. I can't do this anymore.”   “Whoever, what business partner, and anybody in the comms team, and anybody at Mar-a-Lago, and I love the folks down there, but we're at war. They ought to be fired today,” Bannon said."},

         'title': 'Goldman to cut thousands of staff as Wall Street layoffs intensify -source [ASX Stock Market News and Research (Australia)]',
         'news': 'to navigate a difficult economic environment, a source familiar with the matter said.   The layoffs are the latest sign that cuts are accelerating across Wall Street as dealmaking dries up. Investment banking revenues have plunged this year amid a slowdown in mergers and share offerings, marking a stark reversal from a blockbuster 2021 when bankers received big pay bumps.   Goldman Sachs had 49,100 employees at the end of the third quarter after adding significant numbers of staff during the pandemic. Its headcount will remain above pre-pandemic levels, the source said. The workforce stood at 38,300 at the end of 2019, according to a filing.   The bank is weighing a sharp cut to the annual bonus pool this year, a separate source familiar with the matter said. That compares with increases of 40% to 50% for top-performing investment bankers in 2021, Reuters reported in January, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter.   "GS needs to show that its costs are as variable as its revenues, especially after a year when it provided special rewards to top managers during the boom times," wrote Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at Wells Fargo.   "Goldman Sachs now needs to show that it can do the same when business is not as good and that they live up to the old Wall St. adage that they \'eat what they kill,\'" he said in a note.   CONSUMER BANK STRUGGLES   The latest plan would include hundreds of employees being cut from Goldman\'s consumer business, a source said.   The bank signaled it was scaling back its ambitions for Marcus, the loss-making consumer unit, in October. Goldman also plans to stop originating unsecured consumer loans, a source familiar with the move told Reuters earlier this week, another sign it is stepping back from the business.   Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, who took the helm in 2018, has tried to diversify the company\'s operations with Marcus. It was placed under the wealth business in October as part of a management reshuffle that also merged the trading and investment banking units.   Trading and investment banking -- the traditional drivers of Goldman\'s profit -- accounted for nearly 65% of its revenue at the end of the third quarter, compared with 59% in the third quarter of 2018, when Solomon took the top job.   Semafor earlier on Friday reported that Goldman will lay off up to 4,000 people as the Wall Street bank struggles to meet profit targets, citing people familiar with the matter.   Goldman Sachs declined to comment.   The latest job cut plans come after Goldman cut about 500 employees in September, after pausing the annual practice for two years during the pandemic, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time.   The investment bank had first warned in July that it might slow hiring and cut expenses.   Global banks, including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc, have reduced their workforces in recent months as a dealmaking boom on Wall Street fizzled out due to high interest rates, tensions between the United States and China, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and soaring inflation.

The state Commerce Department said overall employment in the state fell by almost 8,400 since October to over 4.925 million people, while the number of unemployed grew by over 6,400 to about 200,500. The total of the unemployed remains 10,100 below the level in November 2021.   Through another counting format based on monthly worksite surveys, the agency reported seasonally adjusted total nonfarm employment actually grew by 5,300 to almost 4.84 million. These surveys found the leisure and hospitality services industry and the financial activities sectors showing the largest numerical increase in employment, with the trade, transportation and utilities sector showing the largest decline."},

It was only a couple of days ago that the crypto token’s price was above $18,000 and seemingly heading higher.The news of  distancing itself from several crypto clients is yet another example of the FTX debacle’s collateral damage. In the near future, there may be other financial firms drafting solvency audits and/or halting business relations with crypto businesses.On the other hand, it’s possible that  may resume business with Binance, KuCoin and .com at some point. If that occurs, the  price might recover and head back toward $18,000.As for .com, the company assured it will “continue to engage with reputable audit firms in 2023 and beyond” as it seeks “to increase transparency across the entire industry.” So, given some time and effort, these crypto companies might be able to bolster their reputations.This will likely be an essential step in repairing the damage that FTX has done to the crypto community.

The advance estimate of October GDP was “essentially unchanged” after a small 0.1% increase in September. We expect little change in the early estimate of November output. Hours worked rose just 0.1% in November. And consumer spending is holding up well for now.

         'title': 'Verizon lost its network superiority - now it&apos;s paying the price [Houston Chronicle (TX)]',
         'news': ' "Verizon bungled 5G and lost its network leadership position," said Roger Entner of Recon Analytics, a boutique advisory group.   Some investors worry Verizon will ignite a costly price war to win back market share, hurting all of the players as they continue to spend billions of dollars on network expansion and upgrades. The last few years have been marked by more stable industry pricing, record high margins and low customer churn.   This isn\'t how the era of better, faster wireless service - known as 5G - was supposed to unfold for the No. 1 U.S. provider. Verizon headed into the decade with a reputation for the best network and service. But management was outflanked by T-Mobile U.S. Inc.\'s rapid ascent in network quality, as well as lower prices, and out marketed by AT&T Inc.\'s free-phone giveaways.   "The Verizon brand was closely tied to its network prowess," said Tammy Parker, an analyst with GlobalData, a consulting company. "But it\'s difficult to pin down what exactly Verizon stands for now, and that\'s a tremendous problem."   The latest trouble erupted last week, when the head of Verizon\'s consumer division departed. It\'s the second time in a year that the chief of the company\'s largest business got the boot. Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg is overseeing that operation for now.   Verizon shares reflect all that concern. The stock is down 29% this year and near an 11-year low, including a loss of more than 2% Friday in New York to $36.96. That compares with an 19% drop for the S&P 500 in 2022. No. 2 T-Mobile is up 20% while AT&T, the No. 3 player, is down over 1% after unwinding years of investments in media and pay-TV businesses and refocusing on phone service.   Next year looks challenging, too. Analysts expect Verizon revenue to rise 1% in 2023, trailing T-Mobile again.   Vestberg, who has taken on the duties of his departing consumer chief Manon Brouillette, isn\'t tipping his hand, saying he\'ll be guided by "what\'s happening in the market."   "There might be segments where it makes sense to increase prices," Vestberg said at a UBS investor conference in New York on Dec. 5 "And there might also be areas where it make sense to be more aggressive."   The good news for Verizon is it\'s still No. 1 by a wide margin, with 120 million regular monthly customers, compared with more than 90 million for T-Mobile and almost 84 million for AT&T. As the company builds out its 5G network, it can remind consumers about its record of superior coverage and reliability.   A Verizon spokesman said Vestberg wasn\'t available to discuss the company\'s strategy.   The 57-year-old Swede joined Verizon in 2017 as head of network technology after more than 20 years at telecom equipment maker Ericsson, where he rose to CEO and then was pushed out in 2016 amid slowing growth. He became CEO of Verizon in 2018, focused on ushering in 5G service.   However, the 2020 sale of Sprint Corp. upended the status quo. With that acquisition, T-Mobile gained airwaves that allowed management to build out crucial parts of its 5G network more quickly than either of its competitors.   Verizon is also having to contend with a reinvigorated AT&T. That company has begun a rebound by focusing on expanding its network, adding subscribers and reducing debt.   Price War?   Verizon, along with T-Mobile and AT&T, raised prices earlier this year to pass along higher labor and supply costs. Customers were willing to absorb the higher bills, showing just how essential wireless service has become.   A price war doesn\'t figure into AT&T\'s plans.   "What do you gain by lowering rates?" Chief Operating Officer Jeff McElfresh asked at the same UBS conference. "At what point do you lower so far just to match somebody else. It doesn\'t seem like a winning strategy to me."   In his public comments, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert now claims to have both the best network and the best prices. In reality, it\'s too close to call. There\'s no indisputable winner on network quality, and prices for unlimited plans by the big three all start at about $60 to $65 a month.   It\'s not uncommon for each carrier to match the other\'s free phone promotions and other perks.   "There\'s kind of an industry collusion going on," said Stephen Stokols, executive vice president of Dish Network Corp.\'s retail wireless division, which is offering a low-priced $25 monthly mobile plan. "They are each getting their signals from the other."   Turning Verizon around will be a challenge for Vestberg, who has never run a large consumer business.   That will involve more than just a new pricing or advertising strategy. Accelerating customer sign-ups requires getting back to what Verizon used to do well - improving the network, its reliability and the company\'s message to consumers, Recon\'s Entner said.   "It\'s going to take strong leadership to break from what\'s not been working," Entner said. "Hans needs the courage to do that."'},

         'title': 'Chinese leaders vow to prop up Covid-battered economy as virus spreads [Times of India, The]',
         'news': ' Xi and his leaders ended their two-day Central Economic Work Conference with a call, via state media, to step up policy adjustments and strengthen coordination to support an economy that analysts estimate grew just 3% this year - its worst performance in nearly half a century.   The meeting comes days after the leadership jettisoned some of the world\'s toughest anti-Covid curbs and lockdowns that had been championed by Xi, but impaired the economy and sparked popular protests unprecedented in his decade-long rule.   China will strengthen overall coordination of epidemic policies, ensuring smooth "transition" during the current epidemic and social order, state media reported in its readout of the conference.   "We must insist on stability first next year while we strive for progress," the state media readout said.   That "transition" into a "year of stability" has started with virus infection spikes in Beijing and fears growing that Covid could sweep across China\'s 1.4 billion population as people take advantage of eased restrictions to travel during next month\'s Lunar New Year.   State media reported on Friday that two veteran Chinese state media journalists have died after contracting Covid-19 in the capital Beijing - among the first reported deaths since the government abandoned its "zero-Covid" policies on Dec. 7.   Yang Lianghua , 74, a former People\'s Daily reporter, died on Thursday, while Zhou Zhichun , 77, a former China Youth Daily editor, died a week earlier, financial magazine Caixin said, citing their families.   China\'s national health authority has not reported any official Covid deaths since the policy switch. The last official deaths were reported on Dec. 3, in Shandong and Sichuan provinces.   Reports of the deaths came as China set out urgent plans on Friday to protect rural communities from the virus as millions of city-dwellers plan their Lunar holidays, starting on Jan. 22, for the first time in years.   But the excitement that met the policy U-turn allowing them to travel has cooled amid concerns that China is unprepared for the coming wave of infections, and the blow it could deliver to the world\'s second-largest economy.   China reported 2,157 new symptomatic Covid-19 infections on Thursday, compared with 2,000 the previous day.   The official figures, however, do not show the whole picture as testing has dropped and are at odds with signs of a wider spread in cities where queues outside fever clinics and empty pharmacy shelves are common.   China\'s National Health Commission said on Friday it was ramping up vaccinations and building stocks of ventilators, essential drugs and test kits in rural areas. It also advised travellers to reduce contact with elderly relatives.   A day after the White House said the United States was ready to help if China requested it, a spokesperson for Australia\'s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said on Friday Canberra "stands ready" to continue Covid-19 collaboration that has so far included the supply of medical equipment and joint research work.   Mainland China\'s international borders remain largely shut, but recent decisions to abandon testing prior to domestic travel and disable apps that track people\'s journey history have freed up people to move around the country.   In a sign of the drive for economic recovery and an indication of the country\'s reopening, business magazine Caixin reported on Friday that the government is seeking to aggressively increase both domestic and international flights by the end of next month.   One of China\'s most populous provinces, Henan, cancelled all holidays for healthcare staff until the end of March to ensure "a smooth transition" as Covid restrictions ease, state media reported.   Multiple cities also opened new vaccination sites to encourage the public to take booster shots, the state-run Global Times newspaper reported.   "Go all out" was the message from China\'s state asset regulator in a statement that urged government-owned drugmakers to ensure supplies of Covid-related medicines to meet "the rapid increase" in demand.   \'Everyone will get it\'   Thanks to the government\'s previously uncompromising controls, China got off lightly compared with many other countries during the pandemic over the past three years, but now many Chinese are resigned to catching the virus.   "Everyone will get it, I guess," a 29-year-old Beijing resident who requested to be identified by her surname Du, told Reuters.   Analysts fear China will pay a price for letting the virus rip through a population that lacks "herd immunity", after long periods of enforced isolation under lockdown, and has low vaccination rates among the elderly.   That has dented prospects for near-term growth, even if the opening up should eventually revive China\'s battered economy.   JPMorgan on Friday cut its forecast for China\'s 2022 growth to 2.8%, which is well below the country\'s official target of 5.5% and would mark one of its worst performances in almost half a century.   China is bracing for "a transitional pain period", analysts at the bank said, adding they expected infections to spike after the Lunar New Year before the economy starts to recover in mid-2023.   China\'s top state planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission, said "arduous efforts" are needed to sustain the recovery in growth due to an adverse external environment and the global economy\'s loss of momentum.   China\'s yuan firmed on Friday as traders remained optimistic that more measures to support the economy would emerge from the conference.   FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA   Visual Stories'},

He described one of his contacts as being “at the very top of the feed chain”.In its report the committee outlined how Shrewsbury signed a written agreement in 2020 to promote SpectrumX, which was seeking regulatory approval for Covid-19 products.Tory peer faces second investigation over lobbying allegationsRead moreThe agreement lasted until early this year. During that time he directly approached officials and ministers, including the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, “in an effort to promote the company’s products”.In his defence, the peer – whose full name is Charles Henry John Benedict Crofton Chetwynd Chetwynd-Talbot – claimed he never sought to “influence policy” and that it “never occurred” to him that he might be breaking the rules.“But ignorance is no excuse, and Lord Shrewsbury’s breaches of the code were in some respects more serious than those in any previous case,” ruled the committee.It approved the conclusions of an investigation conducted by Akbar Khan, one of two  standards commissioners. Khan said the long suspension was merited because Shrewsbury had been a “senior member of the Lords since 1981 and in fact served as a government whip for at least part of the period of his retainer with SpectrumX. He ought to have been modelling the provisions of the code given the prominent role that he held in the house”. Khan dismissed one allegation – that Shrewsbury had used parliamentary proceedings to specifically promote SpectrumX.Since October, he has been sitting asa non-affiliated peerKhan found the peer’s “recollection of events was not always entirely consistent with the written evidence in the form of emails and letters, but I do not think he attempted to deliberately mislead me in my investigation”.Sign up toFirst EditionFree daily letterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice:Privacy PolicyTerms of ServiceThe committee’s report echoes the Whitehall lobbying watchdog’s finding in September thatShrewsbury carried out unregistered consultant lobbyingIn the committee’s second report published on Friday, Lady Goudie, a life peer appointed by Blair in 1998, was found to haveprovided advice to the firm ecoLegacy on how to lobby parliamentarians and government officialsAn investigation by Martin Jelley, another Lords commissioner for standards, found Goudie produced strategic advice for ecoLegacy on which parliamentarians and government to approach; that she had sought information on cremation and pollution from the  library; and that she had demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the use of committee rooms to hold meetings with parliamentarians.Documents seen by the commissioner from ecoLegacy suggest Goudie was offering assistance in drafting correspondence to civil servants in the Cabinet Office or Ministry of Justice. Goudie told the commissioner the letter was never actually sent.She described the recommended six-month suspension as “manifestly excessive and grossly disproportionate” in her appeal, which the committee dismissed.A  Lords spokesperson said: “The chief whip has informed Baroness Goudie that she is suspended from the  whip.

         'title': 'Exclusive-Germany set to assume $230 billion in Uniper derivatives [4-Traders.com]',
         'news': 'Germany is nationalising Uniper in what is the biggest corporate bailout in the country\'s history, after Russia\'s move to choke off gas threw \'s biggest economy into chaos.Uniper has already booked billions of euros of losses on derivatives, exacerbating a crisis as it rushed to plug the gap left after Russia turned off the taps. But even before the Ukraine conflict, the gas giant was under pressure and had to turn to German state bank KfW for support.Reuters calculated the total derivatives exposure using Uniper\'s most recent financial statement, for the first time giving the full scale of the positions, which it confirmed.Like other energy firms, Uniper uses derivatives, such as securing an option to sell gas at a set price in the future, to guard against energy price swings. These carry risks in themselves, however, and have become costly to maintain."In total, we have derivative positions of about 216 billion euros as of September 30 2022," a spokesperson for Uniper said, adding that the riskier part of this was small."Overall, our derivatives position which is related to speculative positions, is in the smaller millions".According to its accounts, Uniper held around 198 billion euros of receivables from derivative instruments as assets.Whether used for hedging or speculation, derivatives carry risks. If the market price falls far short of or soars past an option price, the cost of keeping this trade can jump.To ensure that deals are not derailed by price movements, traders lodge security, often cash, with clearing houses. With recent price spikes, demands for such \'margin calls\' rocketed.an utilities have seen their derivative positions balloon, driven by soaring gas and power prices that require them to also raise the value of these instruments in their accounts. If market prices drop, so do the derivative values.Uniper\'s outstanding positions, the latest to be publicly available, could potentially result in further losses depending on how energy prices develop, one person familiar with the matter told Reuters.That could in turn lumber the German government, which is already spending more than 51 billion euros to prop up and nationalise Uniper, with greater costs once it completes its takeover of the utility, which is expected shortly.Shareholders are expected to approve Berlin\'s bailout of Uniper, which has a key role in German energy infrastructure by funnelling gas to industry and homes across the country, at an extraordinary general meeting scheduled for Dec. 19.LOSSESUniper has reported a 40 billion euro loss for the first nine months of this year, which it said factored in 10 billion euros of realised losses incurred by replacing gas no longer flowing from Russia with purchases at much higher prices.It also factors in 31 billion euros in expected future losses from "valuation effects on derivatives and provision build-ups" related to Russian gas supply curtailments, Uniper said in its last quarterly report.This estimate was based on energy prices at the end of September, which have come down significantly since then."We have to assume that the non delivery from Russia will continue and that there will be further losses. Without the ... gas deliveries from Russia, the gas business will make losses until the end of 2024," the spokesperson said.Uniper, in its nine-month report, said it made a series of writedowns and adjustments, including a 3 billion euro writedown on derivatives and a 9 billion euro loss from derivatives used for hedging, and said there had been an 11 billion euro impact on profit from \'remaining derivatives\', without giving details.One person close to the government said he feared Germany\'s economy and energy ministry, who under Green party minister Robert Habeck led the bailout, had underestimated the risks.The  Ministry said that in its nationalisation of Uniper "all relevant aspects were considered and evaluated, including the balance sheet risks listed in the annual reports".An  Ministry spokesperson told Reuters that Uniper used derivatives to guard against risks in the price of or delivery of energy, or as a hedge against currency swings.Any losses from its overall exposure may be counterbalanced by gains from the financial instruments, which seek to buffer energy price swings with options to buy or sell gas, for example, for a set price in the future.In Uniper\'s case, the volume of liabilities tied to derivatives is up around two and a half times from the end of 2021 and is around six times the equivalent exposure of oil majors BP or Shell at the end of September.It is also more than the 131 billion euros Germany\'s RWE had at the end of June, public data shows.\'POTENTIAL RISKS\'Uniper has already attracted the attention of officials at the an Central Bank, as well as some in the an Parliament. Some officials fear energy companies are acting as de facto traders, but without regulatory oversight applied to banks, one person familiar with the matter has told Reuters."It raises the question: what is behind these trades? The higher the number, the higher the potential risks," said Knut Slatten, a credit analyst with rating agency Moody\'s who described Uniper\'s derivatives position as "massive".Moody\'s examined Uniper as one part of Finnish power group Fortum, its majority owner until Berlin takes over."It depends on the structure of the trades - but here, we don\'t fully see what is happening," said Slatten, who wants energy companies to be more transparent about derivatives.($1 = 0.9406 euros)(Writing by John O\'Donnell; Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Alexander Smith)By John O\'Donnell and Christoph Steitz'},

But it says its efforts to stave off bank run are working.Q&AWhat is a stablecoin?A stablecoin, like the name suggests, is a type of cryptocurrency that is supposed to have a stable value, such as US$1 per token. How they achieve that varies: the largest, such as tether and USD Coin, are effectively banks. They hold large reserves in cash, liquid assets, and other investments, and simply use those reserves to maintain a stable price.Others, known as "algorithmic stablecoins", attempt to do the same thing but without any reserves. They have been criticised as effectively being backed by Ponzi schemes, since they require continuous inflows of cash to ensure they don\'t collapse.Stablecoins are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They provide a safer place for investors to store capital without going through the hassle of cashing out entirely, and allow assets to be denominated in conventional currency, rather than other extremely volatile tokens.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Ultimately, our users want to know that their funds are secure and that our business is financially strong,” said the spokesperson.“To that end, ’s capital structure is debt free and, over the past week,  passed a stress test that should give the community extraordinary comfort that their funds are secure. Despite the large number of withdrawals 12-14 December, $6bn of net withdrawals over three days, we were able to fulfill them without breaking stride.” said in the statement that Mazars had also paused work with other crypto clients. Mazars has been approached for comment.While Mazars worked with , the company stopped short of providing a full audit for the exchange. Instead, a document that Mazars prepared, known as a “proof of reserves report”, was prepared using a method known as “agreed-upon procedures”, in which the auditor only examines areas of the business they are explicitly asked to focus on.In ’s case, that meant examining the company’s reserves, but not vetting claims about its liabilities.

         'title': 'Starbucks union organizers wanted credit-card tipping. Now they&apos;re being left out [CNN]',
         'news': "Union organizers who asked for this new feature months ago are being left out.   It's been about a year since the first Starbucks store voted to unionize, setting off a national movement. Early in the effort to unionize, organizers called for better pay and more input into how stores are run. They also wanted a better tipping option.   “One of the first public demands that we made last fall, when our campaign launched, was for credit card tipping,” the Starbucks Workers United said in a statement to CNN. “This is a clear case of union workers pressuring Starbucks to improve working conditions for all Starbucks baristas.”   As it tries to fend off the growing wave of unionization, Starbucks has been rolling out new benefits and perks that are only guaranteed for employees at non-union stores. Card tipping is no exception.   Starbucks says that it can't legally apply new benefits to stores that have voted to unionize.   “Changes required to implement this new reward channel may modify the terms and conditions of employment for [employees], so we're obligated by law to bring it to the bargaining table before launching it in union represented stores,” said a Starbucks spokesperson. So far, Starbucks and the union have not reached a first contract. Through November, 264 stores voted to form a union, and 58 voted against. There were about 10,200 company-operated locations in North America as of October.   But union organizers see it as an attempt to intimidate workers.   “Starbucks is introducing and rolling out all of these benefits in quick succession to essentially bribe non-union shops to remain non-union, and to retaliate against union workers — to discipline us for fighting for workers rights,” said Billie Adeosun, a Starbucks employee who organized the union drive at a location in Olympia, Washington.   The coffee chain has for years allowed customers to tip when they pay using their Starbucks card in the Starbucks app, or to leave a cash tip. Union stores don't lose access to these options.   But Starbucks (SBUX) only started rolling out the credit and debit card tipping system, which is now available nationally, in September.   Tips grow thanks to new option   Despite reports of a backlash to the new option, it seems card tipping has been generally well received. Nearly half of credit or debit card purchases have included a tip since the rollout, according to the Starbucks spokesperson.   Starbucks teased the option for months before introducing it to stores. Card tipping “has been one of the most requested opportunities … this is something we're going to accelerate as much as we can,” interim CEO Howard Schultz during an analyst call in May.   “You can't prove, of course, that Starbucks took the idea from the union,” said Grace Norris, a Starbucks store employee. “But it's clear that that's what's happened.”   Otherwise, Starbucks (SBUX) would have implemented the option earlier, she reasoned. The practice has become common at other bars, cafes and restaurants. “It is frustrating for Starbucks (SBUX) to continually roll out these new benefits and to purposely exclude unionized stores,” she said.   Norris works at a location in Lansing, Michigan. location, which voted to unionize in June and does not have the card tipping option. But she recently picked up a shift at a non-union location that does.   While working the drive-thru, she noticed that customers added gratuity to their purchase more often than not, making up for any awkwardness she felt in presenting them with the option to tip. At her store, “we would love” the opportunity to earn more tips, she said.   Despite the frustration, Adeosun, who started working at Starbucks in 2015, still sees a silver lining.   “Even though union-representated workers do not have credit card tipping at the moment, it still feels like a union victory,” she said. “These benefits wouldn't even exist without the union campaign.”   Paid Partner Content"},

         'title': 'Exclusive-Germany set to assume $230 billion in Uniper derivatives [94.3 Jack FM (Fox Cities, WI)]',
         'news': "crisis, Germany is also poised to take on the risks associated with 216 billion euros ($229 billion) of derivatives built up by energy giant Uniper.   Germany is nationalising Uniper in what is the biggest corporate bailout in the country's history, after Russia's move to choke off gas threw Europe's biggest economy into chaos.   Uniper has already booked billions of euros of losses on derivatives, exacerbating a crisis as it rushed to plug the gap left after Russia turned off the taps. But even before the Ukraine conflict, the gas giant was under pressure and had to turn to German state bank KfW for support.   Reuters calculated the total derivatives exposure using Uniper's most recent financial statement, for the first time giving the full scale of the positions, which it confirmed.   Like other energy firms, Uniper uses derivatives, such as securing an option to sell gas at a set price in the future, to guard against energy price swings. These carry risks in themselves, however, and have become costly to maintain.   “In total, we have derivative positions of about 216 billion euros as of September 30 2022,” a spokesperson for Uniper said, adding that the riskier part of this was small.   “Overall, our derivatives position which is related to speculative positions, is in the smaller millions”.   According to its accounts, Uniper held around 198 billion euros of receivables from derivative instruments as assets.   Whether used for hedging or speculation, derivatives carry risks. If the market price falls far short of or soars past an option price, the cost of keeping this trade can jump.   To ensure that deals are not derailed by price movements, traders lodge security, often cash, with clearing houses. With recent price spikes, demands for such ‘margin calls' rocketed.   European utilities have seen their derivative positions balloon, driven by soaring gas and power prices that require them to also raise the value of these instruments in their accounts. If market prices drop, so do the derivative values.   Uniper's outstanding positions, the latest to be publicly available, could potentially result in further losses depending on how energy prices develop, one person familiar with the matter told Reuters.   That could in turn lumber the German government, which is already spending more than 51 billion euros to prop up and nationalise Uniper, with greater costs once it completes its takeover of the utility, which is expected shortly.   Shareholders are expected to approve Berlin's bailout of Uniper, which has a key role in German energy infrastructure by funnelling gas to industry and homes across the country, at an extraordinary general meeting scheduled for Dec. 19.   LOSSES   Uniper has reported a 40 billion euro loss for the first nine months of this year, which it said factored in 10 billion euros of realised losses incurred by replacing gas no longer flowing from Russia with purchases at much higher prices.   It also factors in 31 billion euros in expected future losses from “valuation effects on derivatives and provision build-ups” related to Russian gas supply curtailments, Uniper said in its last quarterly report.   This estimate was based on energy prices at the end of September, which have come down significantly since then.   “We have to assume that the non delivery from Russia will continue and that there will be further losses. Without the … gas deliveries from Russia, the gas business will make losses until the end of 2024,” the spokesperson said.   Uniper, in its nine-month report, said it made a series of writedowns and adjustments, including a 3 billion euro writedown on derivatives and a 9 billion euro loss from derivatives used for hedging, and said there had been an 11 billion euro impact on profit from ‘remaining derivatives', without giving details.   One person close to the government said he feared Germany's economy and energy ministry, who under Green party minister Robert Habeck led the bailout, had underestimated the risks.   The Economy Ministry said that in its nationalisation of Uniper “all relevant aspects were considered and evaluated, including the balance sheet risks listed in the annual reports”.   An Economy Ministry spokesperson told Reuters that Uniper used derivatives to guard against risks in the price of or delivery of energy, or as a hedge against currency swings.   Any losses from its overall exposure may be counterbalanced by gains from the financial instruments, which seek to buffer energy price swings with options to buy or sell gas, for example, for a set price in the future.   In Uniper's case, the volume of liabilities tied to derivatives is up around two and a half times from the end of 2021 and is around six times the equivalent exposure of oil majors BP or Shell at the end of September.   It is also more than the 131 billion euros Germany's RWE had at the end of June, public data shows.   ‘POTENTIAL RISKS'   Uniper has already attracted the attention of officials at the European Central Bank, as well as some in the European Parliament. Some officials fear energy companies are acting as de facto traders, but without regulatory oversight applied to banks, one person familiar with the matter has told Reuters.   “It raises the question: what is behind these trades? The higher the number, the higher the potential risks,” said Knut Slatten, a credit analyst with rating agency Moody's who described Uniper's derivatives position as “massive”.   Moody's examined Uniper as one part of Finnish power group Fortum, its majority owner until Berlin takes over.   “It depends on the structure of the trades – but here, we don't fully see what is happening,” said Slatten, who wants energy companies to be more transparent about derivatives.

         'news': 'Recently oil prices have fallen to their lowest levels this year on concerns over rising interest rates in the U.S. and uncertain global economic conditions. As prices continue to fall, OPEC+ announced its plans to opt against cutting production further. Oil prices have declined by approximately 20% over the past month, giving up all of this year’s gains.  Moreover, Goldman Sachs slashed their oil price forecast for the next year’s levels. The bank now estimates that the average price of Brent crude in 2023 will be $97.50 per barrel, down from their earlier prediction of $110 per barrel.  With inflation remaining elevated and the rising possibility of the Fed maintaining a restrictive policy stance, the market is expected to remain volatile.

         'news': "By Medha Singh(Reuters) –     Retail investors are doubling down on Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) as rising interest rates and volatile markets curb their appetite for risky assets such as meme stocks, SPACs and cryptocurrencies.Global financial markets have taken a beating as central banks try to combat runaway inflation with aggressive rate hikes, thereby ending years of loose monetary policy that had underpinned a record rise in the prices of such assets.Vanda Research highlighted a largely risk-off sentiment among investors in its latest report by pointing to a 4.4% year-over-year drop in single-stock purchases by retail traders to $173 billion even as inflows into ETFs rose nearly 14% to $116 billion.On average, retail investors’ portfolios are down about 39% in 2022 after recording gains of 18% in 2021, JPMorgan analysts Peng Cheng and Emma Wu said.Graphic: Retail traders net sold single stocks in 2022, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znpnbblnypl/jpm.PNG   “The ethos is really starting to spread in the retail investor community that if you want to build wealth through your investments, take a long-term view,” Maximilian Rofagha, chief executive officer of Finimize, an abdrn-owned insights firm, told the Reuters Global  Forum (GMF).Finimize’s recent survey of 2,300 retail punters showed that despite their worries of a recession, only 1% wanted to exit their investments, with about 65% planning to continue investing and 29% aiming to invest more despite the cost-of-living crisis.The investment trend, however, is leaning more toward ETFs tracking broader markets and away from the meme stock frenzy of 2021 that saw retail investors banding together on social media forums to fuel eye-popping gains in GameStop, AMC and others. Shares of GameStop and AMC are down 63% and 45%, respectively, this year.S&P 500 index-tracking SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is the most purchased U.S. security among equities by retail investors this year, attracting $26.4 billion in inflows, compared with $17.7 billion last year, Vanda data showed.Other top five purchases include Nasdaq-100 index-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust as well as the ever-popular shares of Apple Inc, Tesla Inc and Advanced Micro Devices.The sudden spike in borrowing costs, soaring inflation and fears of a looming recession have weighed on the ability of the Americans to stomach wild swings in stocks this year.“We don’t expect any speculative bursts to hold without a sustained rebound in both their portfolio and across the market,” Vanda Research analyst Lucas Mantle said.Retail investors’ average daily trading volume in U.S. stocks has amounted to $13.8 billion so far in 2022, compared with $14.2 billion a year earlier, which was the peak of meme stock trading frenzy, according to the report.“Where is future growth going to come from? Fundamentals matter more in the environment that we are in right now when you’re starting to see questions like ‘are we in a recession or not,'” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management in Chicago.As for the coming year, January could see strong equity inflows from retail clients, especially after down market years like 2022, Bank of America Global Research said, citing data that dates back to 2008.Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday voted to propose some of the biggest changes to American equity market structure in nearly two decades, aimed at boosting transparency and fairness while increasing competition for individual investors’ stock orders.(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Lisa Pauline Mattackal; Editing by Anil D’Silva)Advertisement"},

         'title': 'U.S. dollar modestly up as traders rebalance positions after sharp gains [FXEmpire]',
         'news': 'By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Harry  RobertsonNEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) –     The dollar was modestly higher on Friday in choppy trading after posting sharp gains the previous session, with investors digesting a raft of central bank rate hikes as they grappled with the prospect that borrowing costs still have a long way to climb.“With most of 2022’s biggest event risks out of the way, traders are rebalancing portfolios to harness expected shifts in monetary policy trajectories in the new year,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay in Toronto.“The Bank of Japan, European Central Bank – and even the Bank of England – are still seen making modestly-tighter adjustments in the coming months,” he added.The dollar briefly fell after data showed U.S. business activity shrank further in December as new orders slumped to their lowest in more than 2-1/2 years, while softening demand helped to significantly cool inflation.S&P Global said on Friday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to 44.6 this month from a final reading of 46.4 in November. It was the sixth straight month that the index remained below the 50 mark, which indicates contraction in the private sector.In late morning trading, the greenback fell 0.8% against the yen to 136.74, after hitting a two-week high in the previous session.The dollar turned higher against sterling, which was last down at $1.2176, while the euro slipped 0.1% to $1.0620.On Thursday, the euro fell as well after the ECB raised interest rates and signalled it was far from finished, stirring fears about the potential damage to the global economy and sending investors towards the safe-haven greenback.A day earlier, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said policymakers expected U.S. rates to rise further and stay elevated for longer.New York Fed President John Williams upped the hawkish rhetoric on Friday, saying it remains possible the U.S. central bank raises interest rates more than it currently expects next year. The Fed has projected the peak fed funds rate at 5.1%.That said, financial markets do not seem to be buying the hawkish Fed stance. The fed funds futures markets have priced in rate cuts by the end of 2023.“Few expect the Federal Reserve to deliver on Wednesday’s hawkishness,” Corpay’s Schamotta said.The dollar index, which gauges the currency against six major peers, rose 0.1% to 104.58, after rallying more than 0.9% on Thursday.The index has surged around 9% this year as the Fed has hiked interest rates hard, sucking money back towards dollar-denominated bonds. Yet it has dropped roughly 8% since hitting a 20-year high in September, as a slowdown in U.S. inflation has raised hopes the Fed’s rate-hiking cycle might soon end, and better than expected economic data from Europe has boosted the euro.The BOJ decides policy on Tuesday, and while no change is expected at that meeting, some market participants have begun betting on some tweaks to stimulus as Governor Haruhiko Kuroda prepares to depart in April.The risk-sensitive Australian dollar was 0.1% lower at US$0.6694. The Aussie plunged 2.38% in the previous session – its biggest drop since March 2020.

         'title': 'Summer Drill Program Supports Potential for High-Grade Silver at Carlin-Roop [Stockhouse Newswire]',
         'news': 'DHHs ) from 2020 and 2021, have intersected structures containing above background silver in combination with evidence of fracturing, faulting, alteration and mineralization (silver structures) over the 550m± long Carlin West silver in soil zone ( zone ). Part of the Carlin West zone, measuring 120m by 60m in area, is characterized by silver values greater than 30g Ag/t (1oz Ag/t). The 120m length can be extended to a total length of 220m to the southeast (Fig. 1) by decreasing the silver content of soils to ≥20g Ag/t ( zone\'s core ).  Grades from drill core matching assays of up to 994g Ag/t and 662g Ag/t from grab samples[1] along the northeast part of the Carlin West zone have not been recovered from silver structures, which vary from 0.5m to 22m in length. The Company believes that this is most probably because intersections of mineralized core with poor recovery were commonly adjacent to higher grade intercepts in most DDHs in that sector. Those holes drilled in the southeast part of the zone\'s core, with the exception of one hole, were not adequately positioned enough to intersect the zone\'s core within the highly receptive Keno Hill Quartzite (KHQ). The recently delineated 240m by 55m AJ zone, 400m to the north of Carlin West, as yet to be drilled is characterized by highly anomalous silver in soils and grab samples running between 179g and 412g Ag/t.  2022 diamond drilling and detailed soil sampling  A total of 1,070 metres of diamond drilling was completed in eight DDHs focused on the Carlin West z one as delineated from prospecting, soil geochemistry, geophysics and the results from four DDHs drilled in 2020 and 2021. The 2022 DDHs intersected structures along the southwest flank of the recently expanded Carlin West core zone. Of special note is that detailed soil sampling was only completed after the 2022 drill campaign (see press release Oct 25, 2022).  Keno Hill Quartzite ( KHQ ), quarzitic metasediments ( MSD ), graphitic schists ( GSH ) and greenstone ( GRE ) (metamorphosed gabbro and diorite) were the common lithologies encountered in the drilling. KHQ, in some cases interbedded with MSD and GSH, is dominant in holes MLM22-10 through 13. Interbedded MSD and GSH are the predominant lithologies in MLM22-05 through MLM22-09. GRE was noted at depth in MLM22-09, 10 and 13. Extensive silicification was noted in MLM22-05-11. Quartz veining, some parallel, and some at acute angles, to foliations is extensive throughout most of the DDHs. All DDHs contain veins and disseminations of pyrite and pyrrhotite. Galena, sphalerite, siderite, tetrahedrite, siderite and sulfosalts are occasionally present in some structures, especially those containing quartz veins.  MLM20-01, MLM20-02, MLM21-03 and MLM21-04 all encountered structures containing anomalous silver, both in and below the GRE, as they progressed under or parallel to the highly anomalous Carlin West central core zone where all soil values exceed 30g Ag/t. The structures that contain anomalous silver can be projected up through the GRE into the KHQ. A high-grade silver zone is potentially projected in the receptive KHQ where a steeply dipping IP- Resistivity anomaly running parallel to the Carlin West zone cuts the KHQ.  MLM-05, MLM22-06, MLM-07 and MLM22-09 lie along the northwest extension of the Carlin West zone between prospecting samples running from 3994g Ag/t and 662g Ag/t. MLM22-05 crosses the narrowest part of the Carlin West core zone adjacent to grab samples grading 662 and 3994g Ag/t and intersected fine stringers yielding silver values above background over 31m starting at 79.8m. The DDH also contains two silver structure intercepts anomalous in silver; one measuring 1.0m beginning at 83m down hole; and a second measuring 6.9m beginning at 90.1m. The later interval was missing 0.2m of core adjacent to the 90.6m intercept of 8.4g Ag/t.  MLM22-07 collars into the Carlin West zone but is missing an aggregate 1.4m of core within its friable portions. Of note is a missing 0.4m interval of core adjacent to a 2.0m intercept grading 1.8g Ag/t, starting at 4.6m downhole. Starting at 98m, stringers yielding silver values above background over 22m downhole are common with 4 intercepts exceeding 1g Ag/t anomalous silver. MLKM22-06 intersects the Carlin West stringer zone over 15m starting at 85m downhole. It intersected two silver intercepts, one 5.6m in length and a second of 1m in length, exceeding 1g Ag/t within the stringer zone with 0.2m of core loss at the upper intercept. These structures are characterized by fractured and brecciated quartz zones. MLM22-09 contains eight silver structures between 1m and 3m thick above 75m downhole and outside the Carlin West zone plus three structures between 8 and 6.3m long from 84 to 166m down hole, within the Carlin West zone as projected from surface. The lowest structure was within a GRE.  MLM22-13 contains two shallow weakly anomalous silver structures, but both project as being outside the core zone. MLM22-12 was collared at a location where the core zone overlies KHQ. It intercepted a narrow structure containing weakly anomalous silver, at a depth of 84m. An IP-Resistivity profile cutting KHQ and highly anomalous surface soils suggest that MLM22-12, which intersected KHQ above the GRE, was collared in a location having a high probability of intercepting high-grade silver.  MLM22-10 and MLM22-11 collared in the Carlin West stringer zone produced a fractured intercept that did not produce a complete transect of the structure. Soil sampling from this season indicated that these holes were collared in the centre as opposed to the east of the anomaly as was planned. Both holes intersected a lower stringer zone over 10m wide with silver values up to 14.5g Ag/t.  MLM22-10 ended in a mineralized vein 3cm thick. This was below the minimum sampling interval of 0.3m, which was the sample taken from the end of the DDH that yielded 15.2g Ag/t. This stringer zone corresponds to surface float assaying 662g Ag/t and a muted soil anomaly.  Tyrell Sutherland, VP Exploration commented, "The broad silver structures intersected in our drilling this year define Carlin West as a considerably broader silver structure than we had anticipated. Most of these structures were drilled outside of a subsequently identified silver zone grading greater than or equal to one ounce of silver per tonne. The Carlin West structure was identified in a number of holes where it measured up to 22m in core length. At least one other broad structure was also identified in the drill holes."  He continued, "This mimics the historical difficulties defining high grade shoots through diamond drilling within the Keno Hill Silver Camp. Poor recoveries within the broad silver structures are cause for concern at both Carlin-Roop and at some ore bodies in the Keno Hill Silver Camp. This was the case at the Lucky Queen Mine that produced more than 11 million ounces where the silver was concentrated along as little as 15cm within broader gangue veins.[2] Recent drilling does not explain the presence of high grade grabs and particularly high soils at Carlin West. The origins remain to be discovered. This is especially applicable in the broad core zone where the soil samples all assayed greater than 1ounce Ag/t. Through utilizing our oriented drill core measurements, we hope to vector to structural intersections that commonly control shoot orientations within the Keno Camp. The Carlin West core zone, which is defined by greater than 1 ounce of silver per tonne from this year\'s soil sampling, is marked by a number of structural intersections and is a primary target for both trenching and drilling. The AJ zone, as defined by float grading between 179g Ag/t and 412g Ag/t and a 300m long highly anomalous soil anomaly is also a primary target for trenching and drilling next season."  Sample Analysis, Collection and Quality Control  Drill core was transported from drill sites at Carlin West to a secure location in Keno or Whitehorse where a preliminary logs and photo verification of the drill core was completed. Blanks and standards were inserted at alternating intervals every 25 samples. The samples were then sealed in poly bags and each bag was identified with the insertion of one part of a three-part sample tag. Samples were delivered to the BVC preparatory laboratory in Whitehorse. Pulps for analysis were prepared and then shipped to the BVC analytical laboratory in Vancouver, B.C. for analysis and assay where 15g of each sample are being analysed by Aqua regia digestion, ICP-MS analysis (BMV AQ201) for 36 elements (Ag, Al, As, Au, B, Ba, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, Hg, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Sr, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Zn) BVM is compliant under ISO/IEC 7025 and ISO 9001. All processes during preparation and analysis of a sample are subject to rigorous QA/QC control. In addition, a number of blanks and commercial standards were inserted at regular intervals. A review of the results and the quality control revealed no irregularities.  Qualified Person (QP) Statement: Field work was directed by Tyrell Sutherland, M.Sc., P. Geo.

         'news': ', the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has revealed that the auditor Mazars has stopped working with it.The exchange, which has been hit by $6bn of withdrawals this week, said in a statement that the French auditing firm had “temporarily” paused work with all its crypto clients including .A webpage linking towork by Mazars on ’s proof-of-reservesMazars’ withdrawal followsthe collapse last month of FTXcharged in the US customers have been scrambling to pull funds from the exchange, and a spokesperson revealed it handed back $6bn in total over Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday this week.The spokesperson said  had managed the withdrawals “without breaking stride”, although on Tuesday the exchange had pause to withdrawals of the stablecoin USDC, after running out of the asset in its reserves. But it says its efforts to stave off bank run are working.Q&AWhat is a stablecoin?A stablecoin, like the name suggests, is a type of cryptocurrency that is supposed to have a stable value, such as US$1 per token. How they achieve that varies: the largest, such as tether and USD Coin, are effectively banks. They hold large reserves in cash, liquid assets, and other investments, and simply use those reserves to maintain a stable price.Others, known as "algorithmic stablecoins", attempt to do the same thing but without any reserves. They have been criticised as effectively being backed by Ponzi schemes, since they require continuous inflows of cash to ensure they don\'t collapse.Stablecoins are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They provide a safer place for investors to store capital without going through the hassle of cashing out entirely, and allow assets to be denominated in conventional currency, rather than other extremely volatile tokens.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Ultimately, our users want to know that their funds are secure and that our business is financially strong,” said the spokesperson.“To that end, ’s capital structure is debt free and, over the past week,  passed a stress test that should give the community extraordinary comfort that their funds are secure. Despite the large number of withdrawals 12-14 December, $6bn of net withdrawals over three days, we were able to fulfill them without breaking stride.” said in the statement that Mazars had also paused work with other crypto clients. Mazars has been approached for comment.While Mazars worked with , the company stopped short of providing a full audit for the exchange. Instead, a document that Mazars prepared, known as a “proof of reserves report”, was prepared using a method known as “agreed-upon procedures”, in which the auditor only examines areas of the business they are explicitly asked to focus on.In ’s case, that meant examining the company’s reserves, but not vetting claims about its liabilities. Changpeng Zhao, ’s chief executive,has said the company “doesn’t have any loans”Sign up to TodayFree daily letterGet set for the working day – we\'ll point you to the all the business  and analysis you need every morningPrivacy Notice:Privacy PolicyTerms of ServiceThe  spokesperson added that the exchange had “reached out to multiple large firms” to take on its auditing, including the “big four” accounting groups, although they are “currently unwilling” to conduct a proof of reserves report for a private crypto company. “We are still looking for a firm who will do so,” the spokesperson added.Crypto companies regularly fall short of full audits. Tether,a controversial stablecoin providerOn Thursday, the auditing firm Armanino, a mid-sized American auditor, was reported to be ending its crypto audit practice entirely, after signing off on the accounts of FTX’s supposedly ringfenced American subsidiary.The auditor fears that the resulting reputational risk could harm its non-crypto business. It was cited in a class-action lawsuit against the shuttered exchange, filed by an FTX customer who claims to have lost $20,000, according to Forbes,which reported the decision to withdraw from the crypto business'},

He however believes that they can be achieved if there is a unity of purpose among all member states.At the ongoing US-Africa Leaders’ Summit on the topic: “Partnering on Agenda 2063: A Peaceful and Secure Africa” in the US capital, President Buhari declared:“Africa’s security and development landscape has undergone significant transformation over the past decades. The Continent has witnessed increased, diverse and complex threats including climate change, the scourge of terrorism, violent extremism, transnational organized crimes, ideological radicalisation, and recently, an upsurge in unconstitutional change of governments (UCGs).“It is clearly evident that these developments negatively impact national, regional and continental stability and undermine our drive towards achieving AU Agenda 2063 and our flagship project ‘Silencing the Guns in Africa’, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). That is why we must continue to act collectively, in unity and solidarity in our fight against these threats.”In a statement by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, he called on member states to ensure that inclusive governance, constitutionalism as well as strengthening of African Union mediating support mechanisms and conflict prevention mechanisms are emplaced as a panacea to emerging intra/interstate resurgence of conflicts in Africa.“As leaders, we must recommit ourselves to shared values, vision, unity and solidarity, particularly in upholding constitutionalism, democracy and good governance. We must also embrace a multidimensional approach in order to achieve peace, security and sustainable development, in line with our aspirations contained in Agenda 2063,” President Buhari said.RELATEDGroup Lauds NASS Over Bill To Establish Chemical Technology InstituteNHP: Buhari Commissions Housing\xa0 Estate In KwaraThe president noted that while many countries in Africa have conducted successful elections, drastic actions have also been taken in cases of unconstitutional regime changes, commending the improved harmony between the African Union Commission and the United Nations.ADVERTISEMENT“As you may be aware, a number of successful national elections that facilitated peaceful political transitions across the continent have been held. Equally, military coups have been condemned and rejected, with the restoration of constitutional order in some countries and the suspension of four (4) Member States from the activities of the African Union.“There is now improved coordination between the African Union Commission, the United Nations and various foreign partners leading to the adoption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2457 (2019), an embodiment of the commitment of the international community to complement Africa’s efforts to silencing the Guns on the continent.“We have also seen progress in regional cooperation to fight terrorism and violent extremism through the establishment of ad-hoc mechanisms endorsed by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union.“The need to continue strict implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty, Arms Embargoes, including other relevant regional and international instruments to complement and consolidate the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) cannot be over-emphasized. Equally important is the need to ensure the harmonization of the African Peace and Security Architecture and the African Governance Architecture (AGA).This would ensure better evidence-based early warning mechanisms that can be translated to early conflict preventive action by the AU Peace and Security Council,” he added.'},

         'news': "Hopes for an FOMC pivot into rate cuts were dashed as Powell struck a hawkish tone , warning that the Fed ‘has a ways to go' with inflation. And this really furthers the theme that's been pushing stocks throughout this year: The Fed hikes to address inflation, markets get hopeful that the Fed has done enough, or at least made a push towards that end, and then matters reset as US data remains strong which illustrates that the Fed is, in fact, not yet done.   This led to massive counter-trend rallies in June and then again in October. That latter run saw stocks push back to the 200-day moving average, which has been in-play over the past five weeks in various ways, with this week seemingly highlighting failure from bulls to hold above that level with the indication that bears are back in the equation.   FUNDAMENTAL BACKDROP   Throughout this year as the Fed delivered a very hawkish message and pushed a pattern of tightening that hasn't been seen in more than 40 years, markets handled the news relatively well. And oddly, there were multiple periods in which it seemed that equities were really ‘fighting the Fed,' by showing strong bullish trends even as the Fed warned that more hikes were on the way.   In my opinion, much of this was sentiment-related, especially after the knee-jerk reaction of weakness in Q1. The Fed started to open the door for 2022 rate hikes at the September 2021 rate decision, forecasting a single hike for this year. In December, the bank shifted that outlook to 2-3 hikes and as we came into the New Year it became obvious that change was afoot.   And then in January another risk factor arose when Russia started lining the Ukrainian border with tanks. This culmination of risk factors was too great for even the most bullish market prognosticators to avoid, and in the first two months of this year a large bearish reaction developed which, oddly, bottomed on the very same day that Russia invaded Ukraine.   That low on Feb 24th set the low for Q1, even as the Fed added their first rate hike in March while warning that many more were on the way. Equities even rallied after that rate decision, into quarter-end, and little did we know at that time that this dynamic would be setting the tone for 2022 trade…   Sellers were back with a vengeance in April, just after the Q2 open and they ran prices all the way into the June rate decision which, again, produced a dizzying counter-trend move. At that rate decision, the Fed hiked by 75 basis points which should've been a shock for markets. But, a Wall Street Journal report issued on the Monday before the rate decision, when the Fed was in a blackout window, prepared market participants for the news so that when the hike actually happened, there was little shock factor.   The S&P 500 set a low on the day after that rate hike – and then rallied for the next two months, even with the Fed hiking by 75 basis points again at the July rate decision. That rally held through early-August trade until, eventually, Jerome Powell wanted to get his point across to markets at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. At that speech, he took a shorter and more concise message to markets to warn that the fight against inflation was not over and that more rate hikes were on the way.   Markets began to sell-off again and that weakness remained through September and into October trade. But it was on October 13th that another counter-trend move began to show, this time on the back of a stronger-than-expected CPI print, which is pretty much the opposite of what one would think.   If markets are fearful of the Fed overtightening and inflation is still stubbornly high, wouldn't that equate to greater hawkishness from the Fed? Nonetheless, stocks rallied for the next two months, until another CPI print, the one that was released this Tuesday.   And this time, inflation data was a bit more positive than hoped, with both core and headline CPI printing below expectations. But, just like the counter-trend response that was seen in October, the mirror image showed up this week, with sellers making a strong reversal push after the release of that inflation data. And then the next day, Jerome Powell warned that the Fed still ‘has a ways to go' with the inflation fight.   The reason for the history lesson here is to highlight how the fundamental backdrop for stocks this year has actually been very bearish and probably more bearish than what's shown on the chart. But markets aren't linear mechanisms – there's both buyers and sellers and that dynamic exists across a multitude of timelines, so when something suddenly changes, the ripple effects can create considerable distortion, such as we saw this year.   This also puts a bearish outlook for equities in 2023 as the Fed is not relenting. They will keep rates high until either inflation comes down, which will take some time, or until something breaks. Neither of those scenarios appears to be a long-term bullish factor for equities, and arguably, we haven't even seen the repercussions of higher rates yet as these hikes are still relatively new. Perhaps some damage from that has been seen in crypto already, but corporates will have a more-difficult time operating in this higher rate environment and this will start to show more clearly in earnings reports in the first-half of next year.   S&P 500   As of this writing, the weekly bar in the S&P 500 is working on a bearish engulfing candlestick, illustrating this fast reversal through this week. Perhaps more interesting, however, is the daily chart showing the Tuesday CPI reversal, which is the mirror image of the CPI reversal from two months prior on October 13th. Also notable is the continued hold below the 2023 bearish trendline. And then more recently, the breach of support at the monthly lows of 3912 show bears taking greater control of the matter.   S&P 500 Daily Chart   NASDAQ 100   The Nasdaq had a similar reversal theme showing this week, with a bearish engulf on the weekly chart. The notable item here in my opinion is the push back-below 11,700, which is the 50% marker of the pandemic major move.   The 61.8% retracement of that same major move helped to mark the low in October and bulls had made a strong effort to hold support at the 50% marker of that move, with five weeks of support at that level until this week, with sellers making a push back-below.   Nasdaq 100 Weekly Chart   THE DOW   When the S&P 500 and Nasdaq set a fresh low on October 13th, the Dow set a higher-low, holding above the October 3rd inflection. And as bulls came back for the next two months, the Dow was the hot spot, running as high as 23.02% from that October low. This week has seen that bullish structure come into question with price pushing down to a fresh weekly low.   For those that are looking for bounce plays in equities into the end of the year, the Dow may hold some allure, largely on the prospect of support taken from a prior resistance trendline. While both the S&P and Nasdaq remain below their 2022 trendlines, the Dow is still above it's own, and that currently projects to around 32,789, which is the September 13th swing high. At this point, bearish equity approaches appear more attractive in the S&P and Nasdaq.   DOW DAILY PRICE CHART   More By This Author:   From:"},

According to the release the CSRC, China’s financial regulator, and Ministry of Finance allowed “complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in Mainland China and Hong Kong.” The PCAOB inspected eight firms from KPMG Huazhen LLP in Mainland China and PricewaterhouseCoopers in Hong Kong Key.The PCAOB had no problems accessing people, getting testimony or documents without any redactions. Therefore, the PCAOB stated “the Board voted to vacate the previous determinations to the contrary.” This “resets the three-year clock for compliance.” Huge exhale as the nearly two hundred stocks on the HFCAA list will be removed. The PCAOB noted there were deficiencies found which the auditors will need to fix. The SEC statement focused on the future work and compliance needed to be done. We always believed this issue was solvable though policy error was a risk. Due to the hard work by the PCAOB’s thirty plus members, who spent nine weeks away from their families, the US and global investors are better protected.

         'news': ' (Reuters) - Retail investors are doubling down on Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) as rising interest rates and volatile markets curb their appetite for risky assets such as meme stocks, SPACs and cryptocurrencies.   Global financial markets have taken a beating as central banks try to combat runaway inflation with aggressive rate hikes, thereby ending years of loose monetary policy that had underpinned a record rise in the prices of such assets.   Vanda Research highlighted a largely risk-off sentiment among investors in its latest report by pointing to a 4.4% year-over-year drop in single-stock purchases by retail traders to $173 billion even as inflows into ETFs rose nearly 14% to $116 billion.   On average, retail investors\' portfolios are down about 39% in 2022 after recording gains of 18% in 2021, JPMorgan analysts Peng Cheng and Emma Wu said.   Graphic: Retail traders net sold single stocks in 2022, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znpnbblnypl/jpm.PNG "The ethos is really starting to spread in the retail investor community that if you want to build wealth through your investments, take a long-term view," Maximilian Rofagha, chief executive officer of Finimize, an abdrn-owned insights firm, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum (GMF).   Finimize\'s recent survey of 2,300 retail punters showed that despite their worries of a recession, only 1% wanted to exit their investments, with about 65% planning to continue investing and 29% aiming to invest more despite the cost-of-living crisis.   The investment trend, however, is leaning more toward ETFs tracking broader markets and away from the meme stock frenzy of 2021 that saw retail investors banding together on social media forums to fuel eye-popping gains in GameStop, AMC and others. Shares of GameStop and AMC are down 63% and 45%, respectively, this year.   S&P 500 index-tracking SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is the most purchased U.S. security among equities by retail investors this year, attracting $26.4 billion in inflows, compared with $17.7 billion last year, Vanda data showed.   Other top five purchases include Nasdaq-100 index-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust as well as the ever-popular shares of Apple Inc, Tesla Inc and Advanced Micro Devices.   The sudden spike in borrowing costs, soaring inflation and fears of a looming recession have weighed on the ability of the Americans to stomach wild swings in stocks this year.   "We don\'t expect any speculative bursts to hold without a sustained rebound in both their portfolio and across the market," Vanda Research analyst Lucas Mantle said.   Retail investors\' average daily trading volume in U.S. stocks has amounted to $13.8 billion so far in 2022, compared with $14.2 billion a year earlier, which was the peak of meme stock trading frenzy, according to the report.   "Where is future growth going to come from? Fundamentals matter more in the environment that we are in right now when you\'re starting to see questions like \'are we in a recession or not,\'" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management in Chicago.   As for the coming year, January could see strong equity inflows from retail clients, especially after down market years like 2022, Bank of America Global Research said, citing data that dates back to 2008.   Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday voted to propose some of the biggest changes to American equity market structure in nearly two decades, aimed at boosting transparency and fairness while increasing competition for individual investors\' stock orders.

A wide array of foreign companies pulled out of Russia or scaled down their activities in the country after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in late February.

When individuals think about Reddit stocks, it\'s not surprising that GameStop ( NYSE:GME ) and AMC Entertainment ( NYSE:AMC ) come to mind. These two stocks were the poster children of the “meme stock" movement in 2021. And they weren\'t alone. There are a number of speculative stocks that are trending in the social media forum.  The Reddit community, however, is interested in more than low-priced stocks. To be clear, penny stocks still draw a lot of interest from the Reddit crowd. But this is a diverse group of investors. In fact, many of the trending Reddit stocks are companies that are in the portfolio of many retail and institutional investors.  That\'s why it\'s worth paying attention to the stocks that are popular with Reddit investors. That\'s the purpose of this presentation.

         'news': " “With interest rates rising and other pressures on household budgets from inflation, it's a good time to reassess whether your current student loan terms are the best financial fit for you,” said Angela Colatriano, chief marketing officer of College Ave Student Loans, in an email interview.   Refinancing your student loans — trading in your current loans for a new one, ideally with a lower interest rate — can lower your monthly payment or total overall payment.   Around The Web   But the interest rate and monthly payment on a variable-rate loan can change, compared to a fixed-rate loan where interest rates are locked in for the life of the loan. This makes variable-rate loans riskier, especially if your budget is already tight.   When does it make sense to refinance to a variable-rate student loan?   Because the interest rate on variable-rate loans can change, it's best to refinance when rates fall.   Private student loans are ideal for a variable-rate refinance because lenders offer them based on criteria like your credit score, income, and current debt load. These are characteristics you likely were still developing if you took the loans out while in school, according to Kristen Ahlenius, an accredited financial counselor and director of education at Your Money Line, a workplace financial wellness platform. Refinancing now could land you better rates if you earn more or your credit has improved since leaving school.   A variable-rate student loan can also be an attractive option for high earners or those looking to pay down their student loans aggressively, mentions Ahlenius. You could save big if you snag a lower interest rate and pay off your student debt fast   If you choose to refinance to a variable-rate loan, you can do a few things to make it work in your favor:   Contact your lender to understand how often your interest rate can change and how high your rate can rise, also known as the variable-rate cap.   Have a plan for your budget, like what expenses you can cut in case interest rates rise — affecting your monthly payment.   Consider refinancing in the future as rates or your financial situation change.   When to avoid refinancing to a variable-rate loan   Digital subscription only $8.25/mth   Sometimes even the lowest interest rate may not be worth the uncertainty of a variable-rate student loan. Here are a few situations where you may want to avoid refinancing for a variable rate.   If you have federal student loans: Federal student loans , which are loans owned by the Department of Education, come with borrower protections you'd lose if you refinance — like the interest-free payment pause, income-driven repayment plan, relief programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness and eligibility for President Joe Biden's student debt cancellation.   “I find it really hard to argue for a refinance if you are in the federal space,” says Ahlenius. “Ninety-nine out of 100 times, do not leave the protections of the federal government.”   If you have a tight budget: Budgets with a little wiggle room or a cash cushion can stay afloat if your monthly payment rises with interest rates under a variable-rate loan. But if your current expenses take up most of your monthly income, you may want to avoid a variable interest rate.   Brian Walsh, a certified financial planner and senior manager of financial planning at SoFi, describes how a low-interest, variable-rate loan may make sense financially, but for someone living paycheck to paycheck, what's likely more helpful is the security and consistency of a fixed-rate loan.   If you need a longer repayment term: Shorter repayment terms allow less time for interest rates to rise, compared with paying your loan off over 10, 15 or 20 years. Longer repayment periods could use the security and predictability of a fixed-rate loan, according to Walsh.   Fixed rates will usually be the safer option, even if you anticipate rates falling soon.   “After interest rates rise a lot, it's natural to think it may be a good time to choose a variable rate,” says Eric Figueroa, a certified financial planner and founding wealth manager of Hesperian Wealth. “But no one can really predict the path of interest rates. What if they keep going up over the life of your variable-rate loan? Think of the consequences seriously.”   More From NerdWallet   How Life Changes With Student Debt Finish Line in Sight   Even With Payments Paused, Student Loan Borrowers Struggle   College Enrollment Is Down, but Here's Why You Should Still Go   Trea Branch writes for NerdWallet.

         'title': 'Missouri hospital seeks forbearance to buy time for turnaround [Bond Buyer]',
         'news': ' Capital Region reported non-payment related defaults in a Dec. 8th post on the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board\'s EMMA website. The medical center failed to file its audited financial statements for fiscal 2022 ending June 30 within a 150-day deadline. The medical center also fell short of a master trust indenture requirement of 1.25 times coverage of debt service.   The hospital "has hired Kaufman Hall & Associates to make recommendations to the medical center about ways" it can raise its coverage ratios for future years and "is working with its bondholders on the terms of a forbearance agreement with respect to these defaults. There can be no assurance that the Medical Center will reach an agreement with its bondholders," the notice says   Moody\'s downgraded Capital Region Medical Center in Missouri three notches to speculative grade Ba2 on Monday.   The 100-bed nonprofit hospital in Jefferson City faces an additional deadline of Dec. 31 to file its audited financials under a 2020 agreement with U.S. Bank NA, bond trustee and dissemination agent, and warned it could also blow that deadline "until the forbearance agreement is in place."   The medical center reported in a Thursday notice that it would host an investor call to provide an update Dec. 19 with presentations from Gaspare Calvaruso, president; Tom Luebbering, vice president, finance; and professionals from advisor Kaufman Hall and underwriter Piper Sandler.   Moody\'s on Monday cut the medical center three notches to Ba2 from Baa2, making the bonds speculative grade. The system had $41 million of outstanding debt, all fixed rate, sold through the Missouri Health and Educational Facilities Authority, at its fiscal 2022 year close, according to Moody\'s. The outlook remains negative. Moody\'s had put the rating on review in September. It now assigns a negative outlook.   The action "reflects the material recent deterioration of unrestricted cash due to several one-time events in 2022, along with sector-wide operational challenges facing CRMC," Moody\'s said. "Operating headwinds will include elevated labor and supply costs, which have been exacerbated by the on-going pandemic."   Moody\'s expects very weak liquidity to persist through fiscal 2023 with days cash on hand likely to remain around 60 days.   "The rapid deterioration of liquidity is both due" an unprecedented rise in expenses in recent months "and several materially unfavorable one-time events in fiscal 2022, including a cyber-breach, IT implementation issues and default of payment from a major contract," Moody\'s said.   The medical center notified parties in December 2021 that it had discovered an unauthorized party might have gained access to certain employees and patients\' personal, health, and financial information, including Social Security numbers.   The rating anticipates CRMC will secure a forbearance agreement from a majority of bondholders as the required debt service coverage of 1.25 times will fall short for fiscal 2022.   "The negative outlook reflects material and multiple risks that could result in greater than expected operating losses and cash declines during 2023 and beyond," Moody\'s said. "Failure to obtain a forbearance could pressure the rating."   The hospital\'s rating benefits from an integrated relationship with the University of Missouri Health System which provides payor leverage and the ability to access a vast network of clinical resources.   While the University of Missouri-Columbia Medical Alliance is the sole member and controlling entity of the medical center, neither the university nor the University of Missouri Health System are obligated on its bonds.   Remedies laid out for bondholders in the offering statement for the $28.6 million 2020 issue include the ability to pursue litigation to enforce repayment, appointment of a receiver, and acceleration of bond repayment. Holders of at least 25% of principal can direct the trustee to take various actions.'}

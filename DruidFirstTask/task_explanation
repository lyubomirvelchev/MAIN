We need an API endpoint to query the druid server for a feed of Tweets, ordered by time (descending - latest first).

The API should return the row level Tweets with the following information:

Tweet Text

Poster Follower Count

Poster Following Count

Poster Listed Count

Tweet Engagement

Poster username handle (e.g. @ChatterQuant)

Time of tweet

Tweet keywords (array)

Tweet ID

The API should support pagination of results (scrolling), and go back up to 1 month.

Only Tweets with a keywords array should be returned.

Filtering should be available by asset class inclusion (e.g. include stocks, etf, crypto, forex, indices?).

The user should be able to provide assets to search for and keywords to search for.

Example parameters:

prod/dashboard/v2/twitterfeed?asset=cr_BTC&keyword=TESTING&assetClass=stocks,crypto,forex,indices
